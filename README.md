Assignment:1a. Use a hash table of size thirteen. First initialize the table.We want to be able to delete from the table easily.The hashfunction is f(k) = k%13.Use a linear probing to deal with collisions. On the left, show the table afterthe following keys have been inserted in this order:

1b. Given the current state of the scatter table inQuestion 1a, briefly explain how you would search for the numbers 4, 38, and 32.

1c. Show the table of Question 1a after deleting thenumbers 31 and 43. DO NOT ERASE THE FIRST TABLE. Write your answer in the right-handtable.

1d. Given the current state of the scatter table inQuestion 1c, briefly explain how you would search for the numbers 4, 38, and 32.

2a. Given a hash table of size seven with the hash function f(key)= key%7, showthe hash table after the following keys have been inserted in this order. Use alinked hashed structure (p. 292) todeal with collisions.

16,29, 23, 20, 17, 31, 2, 15, 36, 30, 13

b. Given the current state of the hash table inQuestion 3, briefly explain how you would search for the numbers 23, 4, and 22.
